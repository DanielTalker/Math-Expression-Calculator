# Math Expression Calculator

## Overview
The Math Expression Calculator is a versatile Java application designed for computing complex mathematical expressions. This tool supports a variety of operations including basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), as well as advanced functions like logarithms, exponentiation, and trigonometric calculations (cosine, sine). Leveraging the principles of object-oriented programming, the calculator utilizes polymorphism, inheritance, and interfaces to ensure flexible and accurate computations.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Advanced Mathematical Functions**:
  - Logarithms
  - Powers (exponentiation)
  - Trigonometric functions: Cosine, Sine
- **Expression Simplification**: Simplifies complex expressions for easier interpretation and computation.

## Installation

To get started with the Math Expression Calculator, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DanielTalker/Math-Expression-Calculator.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Math-Expression-Calculator
   ```


## How It Works

The calculator reads expressions from the user input, processes them using various classes that handle different types of operations, and returns the result. It is designed to be extended and modified, encouraging further development to include more complex mathematical functions.
